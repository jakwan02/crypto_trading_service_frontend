# Crypto Frontend

This repository contains a Next.js-based frontend for visualizing cryptocurrency symbols and candlestick charts. It features:

- Sorting and filtering of symbols by volume, price change, and update time.
- Market selection (spot vs UM).
- Candlestick charts with multiple timeframes and real-time simulation using lightweight-charts.
- Zustand for client state management and React Query for data fetching/caching.
- Tailwind CSS and a custom dark theme inspired by crypto analytics sites (Binance, CoinGecko).
